# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on fraud detection using logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree classifiers. The models achieved an impressive average ROC AUC score of 0.974. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted, and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to handle the imbalanced dataset. Additionally, anomaly detection algorithms, namely Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor, were implemented to identify fraudulent transactions.
